# Archiving-and-Logging-Data
# Scenario
This project demonstrates the role of a security analyst for XYZ Inc., a financial institution that offers checking, savings, and investment banking services.


The company collects, processes, and maintains a large database of private financial information for both consumer and business accounts.


The data is maintained on a local server.


The company must comply with the Federal Trade Commission's Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), which requires that financial institutions explain their information-sharing practices to their customers and protect sensitive data.


In an effort to mitigate network attacks and meet federal compliance, XYZ Inc. developed an efficient log management program that performs:

Priority-based logging with rsyslog.
Log size management using logrotate.
Log auditing with auditd to track events, record the events, detect abuse or unauthorized activity, and create custom reports.

These tools, in addition to archives, backups, scripting, and task automation, contribute to a fully comprehensive log management system.
